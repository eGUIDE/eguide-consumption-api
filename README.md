# eguide-consumption-api

This is a public API for eGUIDE's energy models, currently providing eGUIDE's energy consumption prediction model. 

The energy consumption prediction model uses satellite images of structures (buildings) to estimate the level of stable energy consumption post-electrification. An detailed explanation of this model and how to interpret the model results is available in the model documentation.
